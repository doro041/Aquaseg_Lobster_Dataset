# Aquaseg_Lobster_Dataset
This repository contains datasets for lobster segmentation and classification, sourced from both underwater and offshore environments. Additionally, a synthetic dataset has been curated to enhance model robustness.

ðŸŽ¨ Synthetic Data Generation

To improve the datasetâ€™s variability and generalization, synthetic images were created based on the following principles:

    Background Augmentation: Changing backgrounds to simulate diverse real-world environments.
    Lobster Variations: Ensuring representation of different lobster types, including:
        Male Lobsters
        Female Lobsters
        Egg-Bearing (Berried) Lobsters
    Body Part Focus: Augmenting and segmenting specific lobster body parts for detailed analysis.

This dataset is designed for few-shot segmentation and classification tasks, particularly in marine life conservation and automated monitoring systems.
