# Aquaseg_Lobster_Dataset
This repository contains datasets for few-shot segmentation of lobsters, specifically focusing on egg-bearing (berried) lobsters. The dataset supports marine life conservation efforts by improving automated detection and segmentation of lobsters in varying aquatic environments.
ðŸ“Œ Data Sources

To ensure diversity in the dataset, we sourced lobsters from different environments and curated synthetic data:

    Underwater Lobster Dataset â€“ [Provide Source]
    Offshore Lobster Dataset â€“ [Provide Source]
    Male, Female & Egg-Bearing Lobsters â€“ Sourced from various online datasets ([Provide Source]) and used for synthetic data augmentation.

ðŸŽ¨ Synthetic Data Augmentation

Since few-shot segmentation requires adaptable models that generalize well to new environments, synthetic data was generated to diversify the dataset and improve model robustness. The process involved:

    Background Replacement: Extracted lobsters were placed onto varied underwater and offshore backgrounds to simulate real-world conditions.
    Lobster Type Variability: Ensuring coverage of different lobster categories:
        Male Lobsters
        Female Lobsters
        Egg-Bearing (Berried) Lobsters (Primary focus for segmentation)
    Feature Emphasis: Augmenting specific body parts such as the abdomen and swimmerets, which are crucial for distinguishing egg-bearing lobsters.

ðŸ¦ž Purpose & Application

This dataset is developed for few-shot segmentation models and will be used in a cross-platform  application designed for automated detection of egg-bearing lobsters. The goal is to aid in marine conservation efforts by providing a lightweight, deployable segmentation model for real-world monitoring.
